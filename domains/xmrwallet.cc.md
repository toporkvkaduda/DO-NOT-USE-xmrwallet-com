# xmrwallet.cc — Alternative Domain #1

**Status:** Active — same infrastructure, same scam  
**Purpose:** "Circumvent country blockages" (operator's own words)  
**Hosting:** Same — DDoS-Guard CDN / IQWEB FZ-LLC  

## Notes
Operator explicitly markets this as a backup domain to bypass blocks.
Identical functionality = identical key exfiltration and TX hijacking.
