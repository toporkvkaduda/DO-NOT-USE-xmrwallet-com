# xmrtor3fsapuu6y26za7vpzox4vpaj6ny5viq2arbmozm7kg6jitnlid.onion — Active Tor v3

**Status:** Active  
**Version:** Tor v3 (current standard)  
**Access:** Requires Tor Browser — https://www.torproject.org/  

## Previous Onion (deprecated)
`xmrwalletdatuxms.onion` — v2, no longer accessible

## Notes
Tor hidden service provides additional layer of jurisdictional evasion.
Same backend, same key exfiltration. Tor does NOT protect your view key —
it is still transmitted to the operator's server over the hidden service connection.

## Why This Matters
Users believe Tor = anonymous = safe. In reality:
- Your view key still goes to operator's server
- Operator still controls transaction construction
- Tor only hides your IP from the operator — it does NOT prevent key theft
