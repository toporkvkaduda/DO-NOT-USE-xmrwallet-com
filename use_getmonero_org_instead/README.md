# ✅ Use getmonero.org instead

This folder exists for one reason only.

If you found this repository because you were looking for a Monero web wallet —
**stop here.**

## The only safe options:

| Wallet | Link | Type |
|--------|------|------|
| Official Monero GUI | https://getmonero.org/downloads | Desktop |
| Feather Wallet | https://featherwallet.org | Desktop (lightweight) |
| Monero CLI | https://getmonero.org/downloads | CLI |
| Hardware wallet | Ledger / Trezor | Hardware |

## Why NOT web wallets like xmrwallet.com:

- Your private keys leave your device
- You cannot verify what code runs in production
- The server can see all your incoming transactions
- If they have your spend key — they can steal everything

## The rule is simple:

> If a website asks for your view key, seed phrase, or private key —
> it's either a scam or will eventually become one.

Close the tab. Download the official wallet.
